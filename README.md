# React Router

This project starts out as a react-router-dom 5 app and will then be converted into v6.

## Set Up

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Switch & Exact Matches`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Links & NavLinks`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `Fetching Data`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


### `Route Parameters`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### `The useParams Hook`

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
